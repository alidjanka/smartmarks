Key commands include initializing the database with `airflow initdb`, starting the web server on port 8080 using `airflow webserver -p 8080`, and launching the scheduler with `airflow scheduler`. Users can inspect active Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with `airflow list_dags` and view specific task details using `airflow list_tasks <dag_id>`. For testing, the command `airflow test <dag_id> <task_id> <date>` allows for local execution of task instances without affecting dependencies. Additionally, backfilling tasks over a date range can be done with `airflow backfill <dag_id> -s <start_date> -e <end_date>`.

        "description": "The article \"Data pipelines: orchestration, choreography or both?\" explores the concepts of orchestration and choreography in data pipeline management. It defines orchestration as a centralized approach where a single component manages and triggers processes, providing a unified view of the system. In contrast, choreography involves a decentralized architecture where microservices communicate indirectly through events, allowing for greater flexibility but potentially complicating management. The author suggests a hybrid approach that combines both methods, leveraging the strengths of each. The article is structured into three parts: an overview of the concepts, an explanation of the hybrid approach, and a sample implementation. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these methodologies for effective data engineering and processing, particularly in complex systems. The discussion includes practical examples, such as using Apache Airflow for orchestration, and highlights the trade-offs between the two approaches.",
